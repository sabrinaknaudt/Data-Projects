# Data-Projects
Uploading my student Data Science projects! 

This includes my final projects as part of my certificate in Key Capabilities in Data Science from the University of British Columbia and coursework from GGR274: Introductory Computation and Data Science for the Social Sciences taken at the University of Toronto. Highlights of these experiences include:

Introduction to Machine Learning-Final Project
- Used scikit-learn library to solve a supervised machine learning problem (classification)
- KNN classifier and LogisticRegression 
- Simple imputation 
- OneHotEncoding
- Automated hyperparamter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- Confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)

Data Visualization 
- Used Pandas and Altair to compose a data narrative about Vancouver street trees from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal
- Plots four visualizations linked to a research question and has an interactive dashboard

Data Visualization-Interactive Dashboard
- Interactive dashboard not rendered in GitHub notebook view.
- If you wish, download html file and open locally to view the dashboard.

GGR274 Final Project
- Used Pandas, Numpy,  matplotlib.pyplot and data from the Ontario Community Health Profiles Partnership to answer: “Is there a higher prevalence of diabetes in low income neighbourhoods?”
- Data wrangling 
- Bootstrap confidence intervals 
- Prepared workflow to be presented as conference slides
